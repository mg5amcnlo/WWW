<center><font color="#008080"><font size=+3>Basic Syntax Rules</font>
</font></center>
<ul>
<li> Particle names (see <a href="../sm_particles.html">Particle names</a>) are separaged by space
<li> Use a  ">"  to separate the initial state particles  from the 
final state ones.
<li>  Use " x x > <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT>  > y y y "  form to require
particle <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT> to appear in
a s-channel intermediate state.   
<li>  Use " x x  > y y y /<FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT>"  
form to exclude particle <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT> to appear in any
diagram. 
<li>  Use " x x > <FONT COLOR="#990099">y6 z1 z3, (z1 > y1 z2, z2 > y2 y3), z3 > y4 y5</FONT>"  form to select only diagrams
compatible with generation of y6 z1 z3 and with the decay of z1 into y1 and z2, z2 into y2 and y3, and z3 into y4 and y5. Note that specified intermediate particles are restricted to be close to the mass shell.
Multi-labels (see below) can appear only for initial- and final-state particles, not for intermediate particles.
<li> Use the multi-label "p" to indicate a proton or an anti-proton.<br> The symbol "p~" does not 
exist. <br>The type of initial state (pp or ppbar or parton-parton 
fixed energy) is specified later, during the run, in the input-card.dat.
<li> Use the multi-label "j" to indicate a jet.
<li> If no coupling orders are given, MadGraph will minimize the number of QED couplings and maximize number of QCD couplings, to remove negligible but time-consuming contributions.
</ul>

from an internal W+ (or W-) are eliminated. As a result only the contributions
from the exchange of a photon and a Z appear.</td>

<td>The maximum number of QCD couplings is set to zero, and the presence
of a Z in an s-channel diagram is requested. As a result possible contributions
from the exchange of a W in the t-channel or a photon in the s-channel are excluded.</td>

<td nowrap>g g > t t~ > b b~ e+ e- ve~ ve</td>

<td><img SRC="gg_ttx_0204.gif" ></td>

<td> This is t tbar production with semileptonic decays for both tops.
Automatically, the maximum number of QCD couplings is set to 2  and the QED is set to 4. 
The requirement of having the two top on-shell, avoids the 
generation of non resonant contributions such as gg>bb~ZZ with the 
subsequent decays of the Z's, giving in total 203 diagrams instead of just 
3. Note that in general, the decay chain syntax below is better for decay processes.
