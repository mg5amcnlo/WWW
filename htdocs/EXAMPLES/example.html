<center><font color="#008080"><font size=+3>Basic Syntax Rules</font>
</font></center>
<ul>
<li> Use a  ">"  to separate the initial state particles  from the 
final state ones.
<li> Spaces, commas and all characters series which do not correspond to the allowed names for
particles (see <a href="../sm_particles.html">Particle names</a>) and do not  belong to the  syntax
(e.g. ">" or "/" ) are IGNORED. Particles names are case insensitive.
For example, "ppxx,x>vZq qWq,q" is equivalent to "pp>Z" (The W has to be followed by a + or a -
to be correctly iterpreted as a W boson).
<li>  Use " x x > <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT>  > y y y "  form to require
particle <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT> to appear in
a s-channel intermediate state.   
<li>  Use " x x  > y y y /<FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT>"  
form to exclude particle <FONT COLOR="#990099">z</FONT> to appear in any
diagram. 
<li>  Use " x x > <FONT COLOR="#990099">y6(z1>y1(z2>y2y3))(z3>y4y5)</FONT>"  form to select only diagrams
compatible with generation of y6 z1 z3 and with the decay of z1 into y1 and z2, z2 into y2 and y3, and z3 into y4 and y5. Note that specified intermediate particles are restricted to be close to the mass shell.
Multi-labels (see below) can appear only for initial- and final-state particles, not for intermediate particles.
<li> Use the multi-label "p", only in the initial state (to the left of 
">") to indicate a proton or an anti-proton.<br> The symbol "p~" does not 
exist. <br>The type of initial state (pp or ppbar or parton-parton 
fixed energy) is specified later, during the run, in the input-card.dat.
<li> Use the multi-label "j" only in the final state (to the right of 
">").

The maximum number of QCD couplings is set to 2  and the QED is set to 4
(even though in this  specific case 99 for both would have given the same 
result). The requirement of having the two top on-shell, avoids the 
generation of non resonant contributions such as gg>bb~ZZ with the 
subsequent decays of the Z's, giving in total 203 diagrams instead of just 
3.
