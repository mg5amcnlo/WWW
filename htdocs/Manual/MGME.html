To set up a new process:
------------------------
1) Run "make" to compile MadGraph (and Pythia-PGS, if it is downloaded
and unpacked)

2) Copy the Template directory to some other name, e.g. MyProcDir, in
order to always keep a clean copy of the Template.

3) Edit the file proc_card.dat in the MyProcDir/Cards directory to set
up one or more processes to be run simultaneously. Don't forget to
specify choice of model.

4) Go to the MyProcDir directory and run bin/newprocess to set up the
specified process. Please notice that this will replace the file
Cards/param_card.dat by the default param_card.dat for the model.

5) Check that the generation worked, using your web browser, by
looking at index.html in the MyProcDir directory.
