Installing libqcdloop1 version 1.9.0

On Unix/Linux and similar systems, you can simply type

./configure [--prefix=/path] [--with-maple=/path/maple]
make
make install

Optionally supply path to maple binary to build a wrapper library
(see usage example in wrapper.mpl)
Use ./configure --enable-f2c with g77 and ifort

Remark for GCC 4.5 users:
With GCC version 4.5 or newer, it is possible to use link time optimization

To do that, run configure with the following flags:
> FFLAGS='-O2 -flto' LDFLAGS='-Xcompiler -flto' ./configure
