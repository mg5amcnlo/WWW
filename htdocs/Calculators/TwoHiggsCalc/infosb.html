<h1>Information on Lagrangian parameters (Generic Basis)</h1>

<h2>Scalar potential parameters</h2>
All quartic terms parameters must be given as well as tan(beta), mu3 and phase of v2. Additional parameters are computed automatically. The overall vev is extracted from SM parameters while masses terms parameters like mu1, mu2 and the phase of mu3 are fixed by the minimization constraints. Lambda1 to lambda4 are real parameters, lambda5, lambda6 and lambda7 are a priori complex. An accuracy value must also be given to fix the relative precision at wich minimization equations in terms of invariants are going to be checked. 

<h2>Yukawa couplings parameters</h2>
Yukawa couplings must be given in the <b>physical</b> basis, i.e. in the basis where the mass matrix is diagonal. Since the mass matrix is fixed, only the Gamma matrix, i.e. the Yukawa couplings of the second Higgs doublet, is required. The other one (Delta) is going to be automatically evaluated to match observed fermion masses. For the Gamma matrix, the first indice refers to doublet generation while the second one refer to the singlet generation. For example, G2B stands for the complex Yukawa couplings of the second Higgs doublet to the second generation quark left doublet and to the bottom singlet.
